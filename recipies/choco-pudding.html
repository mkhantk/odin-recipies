    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chocolate Pudding Fudge Cake is a moist and tender cake that is chocolatey and delicious!</p>
    <p>This is an easy cake recipe that is fun to make for a celebration (like a birthday), 
        and it’s a good everyday dessert cake too. Bake the cake with a simple chocolate glaze drizzled on top, 
        or add sprinkles if you want to party-it-up.

        It’s an incredibly delicious cake!</p>
