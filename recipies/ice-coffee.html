    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Quite simply, an iced coffee is a cold version of your favourite coffee, 
        but it's not simply a coffee that has been left to cool. Like a regular coffee, 
        it's usually a combination of hot espresso and milk. However, ice is added too.</p> 
        
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons warm water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons instant coffee granules</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup ice, or as needed</li>
        <li>6 fluid ounces cold milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li> Combine warm water, instant coffee, and sugar in a sealable jar. Seal and shake until foamy. </li>
        <li> Pour into a glass full of ice; add milk. Adjust to taste if necessary. </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Then you made it. Nice and easy, huh!</strong></p>
